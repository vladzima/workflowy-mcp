      "env": {
        "WORKFLOWY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

        "WORKFLOWY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Basic Usage Examples

Once configured, you can use these commands in your MCP client:

### Create a New Node
```
Create a new WorkFlowy node with the text "Project Ideas" under my root outline
```

### List Your Nodes
```
Show me all my WorkFlowy nodes
```

### Search for Content
```
Search WorkFlowy for nodes containing "meeting notes"
```

### Update a Node
```
Update the WorkFlowy node with ID abc123 to say "Completed Project"
```

### Complete a Task
```
Mark the WorkFlowy node with ID xyz789 as completed
```

### Delete a Node
```
Delete the WorkFlowy node with ID def456
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Connection**:
   ```
   List my WorkFlowy nodes (limit to 5)
   ```
   Expected: Returns up to 5 nodes from your outline

2. **Test Create**:
   ```
   Create a WorkFlowy node called "Test Node" with note "Testing MCP integration"
   ```
   Expected: Creates the node and returns its ID

3. **Test Search**:
   ```
   Search WorkFlowy for "Test Node"
   ```
   Expected: Finds the node you just created

4. **Test Update**:
   ```
   Update the "Test Node" to "Test Node - Updated"
   ```
   Expected: Updates the node name

5. **Test Complete**:
   ```
   Mark "Test Node - Updated" as completed
   ```
   Expected: Node is marked as completed

6. **Test Delete**:
   ```
   Delete the "Test Node - Updated"
   ```
   Expected: Node is removed from your outline

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check the environment variable is set: `echo $WORKFLOWY_API_KEY`
- Ensure the API key has not expired

### "Connection refused"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify WorkFlowy API is accessible
- Check if you're behind a proxy/firewall

### "Tool not found"
- Ensure the MCP server is properly configured in your client
- Restart your MCP client after configuration changes
- Verify Python is in your PATH

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait a few minutes before retrying
- The server implements automatic retry with backoff
