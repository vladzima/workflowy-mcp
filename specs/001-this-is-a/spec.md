# Feature Specification: WorkFlowy MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-is-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "this is a new project, no code yet. i want like to create an mcp server, that would be easily installable by everyone, to work with workflowy via a newly introduced api - https://beta.workflowy.com/api-reference/, using the tool https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or power user, I want to install and use an MCP server that connects to WorkFlowy, so that I can programmatically interact with my WorkFlowy outlines and automate workflows through a standardized interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has the MCP server package, **When** they install it following standard procedures, **Then** the server should be operational and ready to connect to WorkFlowy
2. **Given** the MCP server is installed, **When** a user provides valid WorkFlowy credentials/authentication, **Then** the server successfully authenticates and maintains a connection to WorkFlowy
3. **Given** an authenticated connection exists, **When** the user requests WorkFlowy data through MCP tools, **Then** the server retrieves and returns the requested outline data
4. **Given** an authenticated connection exists, **When** the user sends updates through MCP tools, **Then** the changes are successfully applied to their WorkFlowy account
5. **Given** multiple users want to use the server, **When** they install it on their systems, **Then** each instance operates independently with their own WorkFlowy accounts

### Edge Cases
- What happens when WorkFlowy API rate limits are exceeded?
- How does system handle network interruptions during operations?
- What occurs when WorkFlowy credentials expire or are revoked?
- How does the server manage concurrent requests to the same WorkFlowy account?
- What happens if WorkFlowy API changes or becomes unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an installable MCP server package that users can deploy easily
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate with WorkFlowy using API key
- **FR-003**: System MUST expose WorkFlowy outline reading capabilities through MCP tools
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose WorkFlowy outline modification capabilities through MCP tools
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle authentication credentials securely
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear installation instructions for users
- **FR-007**: System MUST expose search functionality for WorkFlowy content
- **FR-008**: System MUST support:
- Create a node
- Update a node
- Retrieve a node
- List nodes
- Delete a node
- Complete a node
- Uncomplete a node
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single user or multi-user installations?]
- **FR-011**: Installation process MUST be compatible with all platforms and specific IDEs: OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Cursor
- **FR-012**: System MUST respect WorkFlowy API rate limits (currently unclear))
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain connection state either in memory or on disk, whichever works better for the case

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **WorkFlowy Outline**: Hierarchical structure of nodes containing user's notes and tasks
- **Node**: Individual item in WorkFlowy with content, metadata, and child nodes
- **User Session**: Authentication state and connection to a specific WorkFlowy account
- **MCP Tool**: Exposed function that performs specific WorkFlowy operations
- **Configuration**: Settings for server operation including authentication details
